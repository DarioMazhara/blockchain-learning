Learning via this tutorial, which demonstrates how to build a blockchain application with a 
basic mining scheme, conesnsus, and peer-to-peer networking

Design: "every node in the network can add data (strings) to the decentralized ledger (blockchain) 
by mining a valid block locally and then broadcasting that block." - Mario Zupan

"as long as it is a valid block, each node will add the block to its chain and our piece of
data become part of a decentralized, tamper-proof, indestructible network" - Mario Zupan

Dependencies

libp2p = used as the peer-to-peer networking layer
tokio = underlying runtime
sha2 = library for sha256 hashing
hex = transform binary hashes into readable and transferrable hex
